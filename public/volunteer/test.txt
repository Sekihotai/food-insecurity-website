On February 11, 2009, an anonymous user going by the name of "Satoshi Nakamoto" would make a forum post detailing his idea to create an 
anonymous, distributed currency. His idea was bitcoin, and the currency would become Bitcoin.

From the start, Bitcoin's entire purpose was to be uncontrollable. His very first forum post detailing his intentions with Bitcoin said 
"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not 
to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and 
transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with 
our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts... With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need 
to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless." And this can be seen in Bitcoin's structures.

The core of Bitcoin is the blockchain. It manages transactions, and in turn it is managed by everyone that mines Bitcoin. It is perhaps
one of the most impactful pieces of code ever created, but its complexity makes it hard for people to appreciate this.

The blockchain is best described as a record of every transaction done with Bitcoin. Ten minutes worth of transactions are put onto the blockchain
as "blocks". Each block of transactions has a unique number that identifies it, called a "hash". The hash of each block is mathmatically tied
to the hash of the preceding block. The job of a bitcoin miner is to do complex math problems to prove that the hash of the current block is
mathmatically tied to the last. For every hash verified, a miner gets an amount of bitcoin proportional to the amount of work they did to help
verify the hash. This is how the bitcoin economy flows, both through processing transactions and creating new bitcoin for people to use.
